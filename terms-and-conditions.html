          <h5>Disputes & Arbitration</h5>
          <b>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</b>
          <p>ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. YOU MAY CHOOSE TO BE REPRESENTED BY A LAWYER IN ARBITRATION OR PROCEED WITHOUT ONE. THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF, HOWEVER, EITHER THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER OR COORDINATED CLAIMS PROVISION BELOW ARE FOUND INVALID, THEN THE SPECIFIC INVALID PROVISION WILL BE UNENFORCEABLE AND WILL BE SEVERED AND THE REMAINDER OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS WILL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE.</p>

          <p>In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy, including those known or unknown that may be later discovered, between them arising out of or concerning these Terms or any provisions hereof, or other agreements on the Site, other agreements between us, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, at law or in equity for damages or any other relief, legal or equitable, then such dispute shall be resolved only by either: (i) final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and administered by the  JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures as those Rules exist on the effective date of this Agreement or (ii) submitted to small claims court in Miami-Dade County, Florida. If the arbitrator finds this location of arbitration unreasonably burdensome to you, a new location may be selected in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties, or the arbitration may be conducted over the phone, using video conferencing, or similar. You may be entitled to an in-person hearing near your place of residence.</p>

          <p>The arbitrator’s award shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or equitable action, proceeding or arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. Seeking Arbitration: If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send to us, by certified mail, a written notice of your claim (“Notice”). The Notice to us must be addressed to:</p>

          <b>Fintrust Limited LLC</b>
          <a href="mailto:contact@fintrustlimited.com"></a>

          <p>If we initiate arbitration, we will send a written Notice to an email address you have previously provided to us, if available. We may also use any other means to contact you, including a message in your account or to an address we have on file. A Notice, whether sent by you or by us, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If you and we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or us may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. Arbitration forms can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">www.jamsadr.com.</a></p>

          <p>Hearing: If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or video hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules. If your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules. In the event that the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of submitted documents, the arbitrator’s decision and award will be made and delivered within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator, unless extended by the arbitrator. Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules.</p>

          <p>Award: In the event arbitration awards you damages of an amount at least $100 greater than our last documented settlement offer, we will pay your awarded damages or $2,500, whichever is greater.</p>

          <p>Injunctive Relief: Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and we both agree that you or we may sue in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights or in other scenarios where injunctive relief is appropriate. In the event a court or arbitrator having jurisdiction finds any portion of this Agreement unenforceable, that portion shall not be effective and the remainder of the Agreement shall remain effective. No waiver, express or implied, by either party of any breach of or default under this Agreement will constitute a continuing waiver of such breach or default or be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.</p>

          <p>Confidentiality: The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and the Award, including the hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>

          <p>Coordinated Proceedings: If 25 or more individuals initiate Notices of dispute with us raising similar claims, and counsel for the individuals bringing the claims are the same or are coordinated for these individuals (“Coordinated Claims”), the claims shall proceed in arbitration in a coordinated proceeding. Counsel for the individuals and counsel for Fintrust Limited shall each select five cases to proceed first in arbitration in a bellwether proceeding (“Test Cases”). The remaining cases shall not be filed in arbitration until the first ten have been resolved. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the Test Cases, each side may select another five cases to proceed to arbitration for a second bellwether proceeding. This process may continue until the parties have determined an objective methodology to make an offer to resolve each and every outstanding claim. A court will have authority to enforce this clause and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing of arbitration demands against Fintrust Limited. Individuals bringing Coordinated Claims shall be responsible for up to $250 of their filing fees or the maximum permissible under the applicable arbitration rules. All applicable statutes of limitations and defenses based upon the passage of time will be tolled while the Coordinated Proceedings specified in this Section are pending. We will take such action, if any, required to effectuate such tolling.</p>

          <p>Governing Law and Rules: This Agreement and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16). In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrator is not empowered to award punitive or exemplary damages, except where permitted by statute, and the parties waive any right to recover any such damages. In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrator may not award any incidental, indirect or consequential damages, including damages for lost virtual profit.. The parties adopt and agree to implement the JAMS Optional Arbitration Appeal Procedure (as it exists on the effective date of this Agreement) with respect to any final award in an arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement.</p>

          <p>Severance of Arbitration Agreement. If the clauses concerning and describing the procedures and obligations related to Coordinated Claims and Test Case procedures is or becomes invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining entire arbitration agreement and any clauses concerning, relating to, specifying or otherwise describing the arbitration agreement shall be severed from this Agreement. However, any duty of confidentiality whether or not such duty is connected with arbitration shall survive such severance.</p>

          <b>Class Action Waiver<br>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</b>

          <p>YOU AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUALS CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION. CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS/REPRESENTATIVE/COLLECTIVE ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED AND YOU ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ARBITRATION OR CLASS ACTION. Further, unless both you and Fintrust Limited agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

          <p>If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Class Action Waiver and the Disputes & Arbitration provisions shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.</p>
